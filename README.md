# Spotify Data Project


Requirements.txt contains the short list of dependencies required to run the project. 
Install each of them with either pip or conda, and you should be good to go.

For spotipy to work, you will need to grant it access through your spotify account. 
Change the username to your own in the "username" variable found on line 12 of DictionarySorting.py.


You can replace "US_Top200_10-10-2020.csv" with a different top-200 spotify chart 
(you may need to change the constants if spotify decided to change their formatting, but that's unlikely)

Theoretically, the spotify auth process should be working now, but I'm not 100% sure about that.
